  "description": "The signup form contains all the common HTML form fields: input, button, select, textarea, radio button, checkbox and so on. There is JavaScript functionality which checks if the mandatory fields have been filled out before submitting the form. I also included regular expressions that check if the email address, phone number and postal code are valid format, if not a message in red will be displayed to the user right beneath the form element once it loses focus. If a user hits the submit button and there are mistakes in the form, a modal window will be displayed telling which form fields need to be fixed. If there are no mistakes and the user hits the submit button, a modal window will display thanking the user for signing up, and the form will get reset. I also added session storage in order to save any filled out fields. I rebuilt the form with React later on in order to solve an annoying problem where filled out form fields would flicker at every page reload. I removed the checkboxes and radio buttons by setting their display to none and used SVG elements instead. I added programming that will make the checkboxes and radio buttons trigger the input event when a user clicks on a checkbox/radiobutton SVG (the SVGs are set as background images inside span elements).  Note: there is no back end functionality.",
